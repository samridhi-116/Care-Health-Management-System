                            <p>Irritating and painful, it’s no wonder acne can put a dent in your self-confidence. Here’s how to approach treating it</p>
                            <input type="image" src="acne.jpg" id="art">
                            <p>
                                Those of us who’ve suffered with acne in our lives will know how frustrating it is when someone chips in with unsolicited advice about how we should wash our face more, eat healthier, or leave spots make-up free – if only it were that simple! The reality
                                is that acne is a complex skin condition that varies from person to person and often needs specialist treatment from a dermatologist. But the good news is, these days, even serious cases can be dramatically improved with
                                the right combination of treatments.<br> ‘Several factors contribute to acne, but the main one is a genetic predisposition,’ says Dr Stefanie Williams, clinical dermatologist and medical
                                director of European Dermatology London. ‘The wrong skincare and hormonal fluctuations (due to menstruation, coming off the pill and stress) can cause flare-ups, but only if you already have a genetic susceptibility.’ And
                                if you’re wondering whether diet affecting your skin is a myth, ‘food can affect it,’ Williams explains, ‘but for most people it’s not as strong as often thought. Too much sugar or processed starchy foods can make existing
                                acne worse, but someone without that genetic link could have a sinful diet and still have clear skin.’ Unfair, right?<br>

                                <h3><b>How to treat acne</b></h3>
                                ‘Acne is a skin disease, so don’t think of it as a cosmetic problem and try to get rid of it with semi-effective treatments, like salon peels or microdermabrasion,’ says Williams. ‘You’ll need prescription creams and, in severe cases, prescription tablets
                                along with dermatology grade facials.’ <br> Acne creams come in two groups: antibiotics to fight acne bacteria, and pore-unplugging creams, such as vitamin A derivatives (a clogged pore is
                                the first step to spot forming). ‘Ideally, a combination of both works best,’ says Williams. ‘If creams aren’t enough, you might have to take an oral antibiotic and, if that’s not working, we might prescribe vitamin A tablets
                                (isotretinoin), which are known to switch off acne for good in most people.
                                <br>

                                <h3><b>How to get rid of acne scars</b></h3>
                                For those self-conscious about the scars leftover from acne, there are procedures that can help. ‘Aesthetic treatments such as micro-needling (which kicks skin into repair mode, boosting collagen production and skin regeneration) are effective,’ says
                                Williams. However, remember that while micro-needling can reduce the appearance of scars, it’s unlikely to eradicate them completely. ‘For ice-pick scars, which are narrow and very deep, we can use TCA cross [chemical reduction
                                of scars] treatment,’ says Williams. ‘This is where trichloroacetic acid is put into individual scars using a toothpick.’ <br>

                                <h3><b>How to look after your skin at home</b></h3>
                                Don’t overload skin with products, use moisturisers, sun protection and make-up that’s oil free. ‘Cleansers should be non-creamy, non-oily foaming formulas – ones containing salicylic acid, glycolic acid and retinol will also exfoliate skin and help to
                                prevent clogged pores,’ says Williams. In addition to that, avoiding too much sugar in your diet can help keep flare-ups at bay.

                                The beauty of this vegan lentil dal recipe is that you can stick it in your slow cooker in the morning and forget about it – all you need to do in the evening is cook your rice and dinner is ready! Lentils are an excellent source of plant-based protein,
                                while tomatoes provide vitamin C, needed for a healthy immune system. Plus, it’s topped with toasted cashews, which provide heart-healthy fats, and give a satisfying crunch. It’s the perfect comfort dish for a cold winter’s
                                evening.

                                low or 6 hours on high.)<br> 5. When it’s ready, stir your lentil dal and season with salt and freshly ground pepper, to your taste. Serve with basmati rice and a little coconut cream drizzled over the top and garnish with
                                the toasted cashews, sliced chilli and fresh coriander.<br> Cooking note:<br> If you don’t have a slow cooker, you can cook this dal on the stove. Use a large lidded casserole dish to cook the onions in and then add the
                                tomatoes, lentils and stock. Cook, stirring occasionally, for around 40 minutes or until the liquid has been absorbed.<br>

                            <p>Dr Attam Singh of the London Pain Clinic discusses how we can overcome musculoskeletal pain
                            </p>
                            <input type="image" src="joint pain.jpg" id="art">
                            <p>
                                We tend to think of joint pain as something that just affects elderly patients, but you can get early onset arthritis as a result of trauma, sport or repetitive injuries. There are also juvenile and genetic causes of joint pain – such as psoriatic arthritis,
                                which affects people with psoriasis; or sceptic arthritis, which is due to an infection.
                                <br> Pain is experienced through three main categories. First, after trauma to tissues or when organ pain receptors transfer chemicals and impulses to the central nervous system, and the central nervous system transfers
                                them to our brain. The other route is a trauma to the nervous system itself, which includes the nerves, the central spinal cord and the brain. The final category is when the nervous system is not working appropriately,
                                so the brain perceives normal impulses as being painful.
                                <br> We all share these common processes, but the level of impulses felt and the amount of chemicals released vary hugely, so the severity of pain experienced is different from person to person. On top of that, there are
                                huge social, environmental, and genetic influences, as well as the impact of the way you were brought up. <br> Lower back pain is the biggest cause of disability across all age groups, and it’s estimated that eight in every
                                10 people will experience back pain at some point. That’s because the back is consistently and continuously in use; it doesn’t rest. Even when you’re sitting, relaxing, there will be some degree of tension in your back.
                                The only time it rests is when you’re asleep, but even then it may be in a twisted position with your back muscles out of sync. Even within the NHS, we’ve only recently realised how important back care is for longevity.
                                Ten or 15 years ago it was an afterthought and we’re seeing the consequences of that now.
                                <br>
                                <h3><b>Our weight matters</b></h3>
                                Studies clearly show that reducing weight reduces the risk of musculoskeletal disorders, particularly osteoarthritis in the hips and knees. There are causes of joint pain you can’t do anything about, like rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis, which
                                you’re born with, but you can influence your weight.<br>
                                <h3><b>Which supps?</b></h3>
                                Diet-wise, vitamin D, calcium and fish oils are crucial. You need to avoid inflammatory foods, so that means high sugar content foods, additives and processed meats. Cod liver oil is beneficial to joints but also good for your heart and digestion, and
                                we regularly check vitamin D levels in clinic because a lack of it can cause joint pain.
